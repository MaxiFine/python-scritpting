## Subprocess management

The subprocess module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. 

The subprocess module in Python is a built-in module that allows us to create new child processes.

Think of it as a way to programmatically interact with your computer using Python instead of manually entering commands in the terminal. 

## Uses of Subprocess Module
- Run system commands or external programs from your Python script.
- They can handle input, output, and errors caused by child programs in your Python code
- Capture the output (stdout) and error messages (stderr) generated by these commands.
- Communicate with the running process by sending input (stdin).
- Wait for the command to complete and obtain its return code to check for success or failure.

# Python Subprocess check_output
In the subprocess module, check_output is a function that closely resembles run(). It has the specific behavior of returning only the standard output of the command.
